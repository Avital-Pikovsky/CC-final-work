### To run the code:
To run the code it is necessary to run operations in the following order:

- Attach a text file named: sample_input.txt 

- Which will have a sequence of threes of packages that we want to transfer, in the following way:

> (amount, slack, value).

- Open the terminal and run the makefile with the command: `make`

 - After this command, two executable files will be created:
 
 1.edf
 
 2.bd

- To run the program, write the following command:

 `./"algorithm" "queue size" "file name"`


- For example:

 `./edf 4 sample_input.txt `

- or:

 `./bd 4 sample_input.txt `
